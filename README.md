# wifi-zapper

Dont under estimate the small amount of files. wifi-zapper is a powerful tool that runs a ping of death to any device or ip. Be careful though! You dont want to 
crash a big server!


#Installation


`sudo git clone https://github.com/ZigedZaged123/wifi-zapper`

`cd wifi-zapper`

`alias wifi-zapper='bash wifi-zapper'`

`wifi-zapper <target> (options)`

And its that simple!

# How does it work?

wifi-zapper will ping an ip in fragments over and over and over.
The device gets confused and eventually crashes the device.
Making this and effective DoS attack!
